I don't read the whole book at once. I jump between books and sometimes go back to any impromptu book. Just read 2/5. Drop me a message if you have any recommendation.

- `Homo Sapiens`
- `Homo Deus`
- `Permanet Record`
- The future of foreign intelligence, privacy and surveillance in a digital age
- The Arsenal of Democracy
- You Have the Right to Remain Innocent by James Duane
- Sex Trafficking Inside the Business of Modern Slavery
